            - Hello! I'm a passionate beginner Web Developer with a strong
            interest in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
            I recently built this personal portfolio to showcase my skills and
            projects. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            and I'm continually expanding my knowledge by working on new
            challenges and learning modern frameworks and tools. I'm excited to
            grow as a developer, collaborate with others, and build digital
            experiences that make a difference.{" "}

            designing intuitive UIs to integrating APIs and deploying responsive
            apps, I‚Äôve worked hands-on with React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and
            tools like EmailJS and GitHub.
